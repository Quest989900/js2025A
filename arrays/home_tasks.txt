1. Monthly Budget Calculator
Given an array of your monthly expense amounts, 
use a loop to compute the total expense and then 
calculate the average.

2.Temperature Analyzer
With an array of daily temperatures (in °C), 
find the highest and lowest temperatures by 
iterating once through the array.

3. Discounted Prices Generator
Given an array of product prices and a fixed 
discount rate (e.g. 10%), loop through the prices 
to build a new array of discounted prices.

4. Counting Age Groups
From an array of people’s ages, count how many 
are minors (under 18) and how many are adults 
(18 and over).

5. High‑Spending Transactions
Given an array of amounts , 
find and collect all amounts above a 
certain threshold (e.g. N1000) into a new array.

6. Word Length Mapper
Starting with an array of words, build a parallel 
array of the corresponding word lengths.

7 Find an Item’s Index
Given your shopping list array and a target item, 
loop to locate its index (or return –1 if not found).

8. Reverse an Array In‑Place
Without using the built‑in method, swap elements 
in the array via a loop to reverse it manually.

9. Duplicate Removal
From an array that may contain duplicate entries 
(e.g. attendee names), build a new array of 
uniques by checking with a loop and using indexOf 
to avoid repeats.

10. Word‑Counting in a Sentence
Split a sentence into words (using String.split), 
then loop through the resulting array to count 
how many words start with a vowel.
